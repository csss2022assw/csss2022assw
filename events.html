  <h2 style="margin-top: 25px">CSSS-ASSW 2022 Mid-Conference One-Day Field Tour</h2>

  <p> A mid-conference field tour will be organized for <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">May 26, 2022</span>, to observe soils, agricultural production and native land cover near Edmonton, the capital of Alberta.</p>
  <p>During this bus tour, participants will visit three sites showcasing three distinct types of landscapes, soils and land uses in the Edmonton vicinity. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; color: black">En-route</span> lectures would allow participants to see landscapes from agricultural and soil perspectives, tracking changes in natural features and land uses. The tour will accommodate up to <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">150</span> participants but will be arranged in a way that allows small groups of people to easily examine each soil pit at a time. The three stops include:</p>
  <p><span>St Albert Research Station</span> (Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences, University of Alberta). This research station is located near the City of St. Albert, just north of Edmonton. Located on fertile plain left by the former Glacial Lake Edmonton, this area has been used for agriculture for about 150 years. The soil complex at the Station consists of Black Chernozems and a variety of Gleysolic soils in shallow depressions. Soils are developed on fine textured glaciolacustrine clays that feature some salinity. Presentation at the tour stop will review land use, surficial geology, and landforms. Tour participants will be able to examine two soil pits, one showing a Chernozemic soil and another a Gleysol.</p>
  <p><span>Hastings Creek</span> (Beaver Hill Biosphere Reserve). This portion of the Beaverhill Upland is a fine example of a hummocky (knob and kettle) disintegration moraine. Soils in this upland are predominantly Dark Gray Luvisols with a significant proportion of Gleysols and Organic soils in depressions. Tour participants will be able to examine a transect across the morainal knob exposed in a roadcut. Beaver Hills represent a mix of land uses from rural communities and acreages to farm fields, forested areas, wetlands, and small lakes. Active conservation within the Beaver Hills dates back to the end of the 19th century. In 2016, this area was recognized as a biosphere reserve by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p>
  <p><span>Bruderheim Dunes</span>. Located in close proximity to the North Saskatchewan River valley, this site showcases stabilized sand dunes formed during deglaciation along a meltwater channel. Parent materials include eolian veneers and blankets over gently undulating glaciolacustrine clay sediments. Sandy Black Chernozems in this landscape are intermixed with Organic and Gleysolic soils in depressions. Tour participants will be able to examine a parabolic dune exposed in a roadcut and discuss salinity issues associated with agricultural use in the surrounding landscape.</p>
  <p>Boxed lunches will be provided. Coffee, beverages, and snacks will be available at multiple locations throughout the day. The bus tour will start from the North Campus of the University of Alberta and will return to the same location after the 10-hour long journey.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 50px">CSSS-ASSW 2022 Post-Conference Three-Day Field Tour</h2>

  <p> A three-day post-conference field tour will be organized for <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">May 28-30, 2022</span>. This field trip will take participants to see soils, geology and landscapes across the Alberta Plains, Foothills and the Rocky Mountains west of Edmonton.</p>
  <p>During this bus tour, participants will visit nine sites showcasing a variety of natural landscapes of central and western Alberta. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; color: black">En-route</span> lectures will allow participants to see landscapes from agricultural and soil perspectives and will identify changes in natural features and land use. The tour will accommodate up to <span style="color:black; font-weight:bold">45</span> participants but will be arranged in a way that allows small groups of people to easily examine each soil pit at a time. Grouped by days, the stops of the tour include:</p>
  <p><span>Day 1: Edmonton to the Banff National Park</span>. Participants will travel from the basin of former glacial lake Edmonton consisting of Black Chernozems into morainal landscapes featuring Gray Luvisols. Various agricultural practices observed supplemented by results of academic research on crop rotation and fertilizing systems will be showcased at sites previously shown to participants of the 11th ISSS Congress in 1978. Lunch will be provided at the second site visited.  Leaving the Alberta Plains, the tour will travel through Rocky Mountains Foothills where a soil catena with bisequa Gray Luvisol paired with a nearby Terric Mesisol will be examined. Overnight stay at the Crossing Resort will provide an excellent opportunity to enjoy the Banff National Park setting firsthand.  Dinner at the restaurant with a mountain view and the opportunity to further examine the surrounding landscape will complement the overnight stay.</p>
  <p><span>Day 2: Banff and Jasper National Parks</span>. The bus tour will travel through Banff and Jasper National Parks examining soils in proximity to the Athabasca Glacier (Columbia Icefield), then a stop at Athabasca Falls for lunch which will be provided and ending the day at two sites comparing Brunisols and bisequa Luvisols developed on a Cordilleran till. Participants will see changes between Subalpine and Montane natural regions with discussions on glacier dynamics, forestry topics and recreational activities in the area. Overnight stay at a hotel in Hinton will be accompanied by a fine dinner. Recognizing the tour will be travelling through Montane and Subalpine areas in the spring, please be aware that adverse weather conditions may be expected.</p>
  <p><span>Day 3: Hinton to Edmonton</span>. The tour will visit a reclaimed coal mine area in the subalpine area focusing on land reclamation practices, classification of human-made soils and comparing those to undisturbed Brunisols located near the disturbed area.  Other stops of the day include a variety of Luvisols in the Foothills. A catena examined in the Upper Foothills will include a Brunisolic Gray Luvisol and a nearby Typic Mesisol. Lower Foothills will be presented by a Dark Gray Luvisol developed on shallow till over bedrock. Lunch will be provided in Hinton. The tour will return to the North Campus of the University of Alberta (Edmonton), the original starting point.</p>
